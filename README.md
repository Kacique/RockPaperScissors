# RockPaperScissors
A SwiftUI Rock, Paper, Scissors game
This GitHub project is a Rock, Paper, Scissors game with a twist. In each of the 10 turns, 
the app randomly picks rock, paper, or scissors and prompts the player to either win or lose.
Players must choose the correct move based on the given prompt. Correct choices earn a point,
while incorrect ones result in losing a point. The game ends after 10 questions, and the final 
score is displayed.
